What is Algorithn?
- A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
- Almost everything you do in the programming involves some sort of it
How do u improve in it?
- Devise a plan for solving problems
- Master common problem solving patterns
Problem Solving Strategies
- Understand the problem
    - Ask questions to understand it 
    - Restate it in your own words
    - What are the inputs
        - Type of them
        - Validation if some are null or another types
        - Upper and lower validations
    - What are the outputs should come from the solution
        - Type of them
        - Output from the other cases (not the happy cases)
    - Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do you have enough information to solve the problem)
    - Try to label the important pieces of the data that are a part of the problem.

- Explore Concrete examples
    - Come up with examples can help you understand the problem better
    - Examples also provide sanity checks that your eventual solution works how it should
    - Use: user stories - unit tests
        - Start with simple examples
        - Progress to more complex ones (e.g. Egdes)
        - Examples with empty inputs
        - Examples with invalid inputs
- Break it down
    - Explicitly write out the steps you need to take to force you think about the code before you write it
    - You can write comments before starting in the code
- Solve / Simplify
    - Solve the problem and if you can't, just solve a simpler problem (happy case)
    - Find the core difficulty in what you are trying to do
    - Temporarily ignore that part
    - Write a simplified solution
    - Then back to that difficulty part
- Look back and refactor
    - Can you check the result?
    - Can you derive the result differently?
    - Can you understand it at a glance?
    - Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
    - Can you improve the performance of your solution?(time/space complexity)
    - Can you think of other ways to refactor?
    - How have other people solved this problem?(Check others' answers)
